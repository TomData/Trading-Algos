# coinglass liquidations

im looking to constanlty anlyze the liquidations in the last hour, 4 hours, 24 hours etc. and see if they are bulls or bears getting liquidated and this lead to so many ideas. 

examples
- if 30m+ liquidations of longs in the past hour, is that a signal to go long or short?
- if the amount of liquidations is 10x higher in the last hour in total (longs and shorts) is this a time to go long or short or cash?

ideas
- with liq data, if my bot wants to long, it should wait until Liquidations of buyers because then it should be a better price. 

notes-
- to get more refined data 1min-30min its 379/mo, think about how to build this and give to community for free
