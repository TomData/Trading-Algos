# Low  cap gem finder

overview
- we are going to search coingecko for undervalued altcoins with our bot

- using the trending

ideas
- make a lil website that shows all the top coins
- count the number of times that a coin is in the trending and rank them by that


todo 
- reverse order of list
- top 3 in 24, 48, 72 hours
- post to a website, or discord... or both
    - i need to set this up on a server so that it can run 24/7 and the data is constantly updated
