# Low  cap gem finder

This bot watches the coin gecko trending search throughout the day and then posts them to a website so we dont miss any trending coins. it also sends them to this discord channel: https://discord.gg/yn7U4T2hbW

- using the trending

ideas
- make a lil website that shows all the top coins
- count the number of times that a coin is in the trending and rank them by that


todo 
- reverse order of list
- top 3 in 24, 48, 72 hours
- post to a website, or discord... or both
    - i need to set this up on a server so that it can run 24/7 and the data is constantly updated
