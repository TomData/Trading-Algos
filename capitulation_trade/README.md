# capitulation trade

overview:
we are looking for huge volume spikes on the daily time frame of ETH. Spot only, long only. and when a huge volume spike happens on the daily, we buy. see the example.png for the volume spikes

we will have to test multiple multipliers on the volume spikes. is it best to buy when the daily is 2x the volume, 3x, 10x? we will have to backtest and see

question to answer: is it better to DCA or is it better to DCA only on capitulation days?

think about:
- how/when do we sell?
